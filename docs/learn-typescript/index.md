# Learn TypeScript

This section contains a practical introduction to the TypeScript programming language aimed at new developers who wants to learn it to use with TSWoW specifically.

There are other TypeScript resources out there, but they usually assume usage with frameworks like ReactJS that aren't relevant at all for TSWoW.

I've tried to write these to work as someone's first introduction to computer programming in general, but I'm not a teacher and you might want to seek out additional resources if you feel stuck.

If you already have a good grasp on computer programming for another language, you can probably skip these tutorials and head directly for [getting-started](./getting-started).
